### Hi there 👋

I am the developer and maintainer of [`komorebi`](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi), the most starred, actively developed tiling window manager for Windows on GitHub.

If `komorebi` is an integral part of your professional or personal workflow, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/LGUG2Z) - even if it's just $1/month.

🔭 I curate RSS feeds of high-quality commentary from across the internet on various topics that I'm interested in
- [Software development](https://notado.app/feeds/jado/software-development) (What makes good and bad software development experiences)
- [Social media](https://notado.app/feeds/jado/social-media) (The state of different social media services, user generated content and recommendation algorithms)
- [Addiction](https://notado.app/feeds/jado/addiction) (Living with, overcoming and life after addiction)
- [Mental health](https://notado.app/feeds/jado/mental-health) (Factors impacting our mental health in the modern age)
- [Capitalism](https://notado.app/feeds/jado/capitalism) (How capitalism intersects with work, art, technology, urban planning, life and love)
