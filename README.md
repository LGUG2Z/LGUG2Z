## Hi there üëã

### komorebi

I am the developer and maintainer of [`komorebi`](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi), the most starred, actively developed tiling window manager for Windows on GitHub.

If you want to use `komorebi` at work, you are required to purchase an [individual commercial use license](https://lgug2z.com/software/komorebi).

Otherwise, if `komorebi` is an integral part of your personal workflow, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/LGUG2Z).

You can also tip on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/lgug2z/), and make anonymous Bitcoin (`bc1qv73wzspc77k46uty4vp85x8sdp24mphvm58f6q`) donations.

If you are not in a position to sponsor or donate, the next best thing you can do to support the project is [subscribe to my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeai3-do-9O4MNy9_xjO6mg?sub_confirmation=1), where I post development and release overview videos.

### Licensing

My software is typically released under the [Komorebi License](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi-license), an [educational source](https://lgug2z.com/articles/educational-source-software/) and firewall license for people who reject [genocide-friendly software licensing](https://opensource.org/faq#evil).

I write about post-open source software licensing philosophies [through a certain lens](https://lgug2z.com/articles/on-open-source-mythology/), and encourage new generations of developers to [critically interrogate the open source dogmatism](https://lgug2z.com/articles/on-evils-in-software-licensing/) which multi-million, billion and trillion dollar corporations target them with in both direct and indirect ways.

I also make dedicated individual commercial use licenses available for [some of my software](https://lgug2z.com/software).

Many employers reimburse software licensing costs, so don‚Äôt forget to submit a reimbursement request to your employer with your receipt(s).

With mainstream corporate software reimbursement policies, the individual commercial use license functions as a mechanism to empower end users to mediate corporate contributions to the financial sustainability of independent software - united we bargain, divded we beg.
